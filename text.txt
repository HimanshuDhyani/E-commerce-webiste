One of the biggest trends of 2019 is expected to be gender-neutral fashion. 
"It's fitting to see more and more androgynous looks walking down the runway,
" personal stylist and CEO of CBS Lifestylist Catherine Bachelier Smith opined to The List. 
"Sometimes I feel like wearing a pretty dress and sometimes I steal my husband's button down
 to finish off my Annie Hall (menswear) look." We hear that.

                            At the Spring 2019 Ready-To-Wear fashion show in New York, 
many of the looks designed by Tibi featured gender-neutral apparel. 
But Tibi isn't the only brand embracing genderless fashion.
 Louis Vuitton, Valentino, and others have also began designing similar looks as 2019 drew near. 
In fact, Vogue fashion critic Anders Christian Madsen feels 2019 is going to "revolutionise the way we see and wear clothes.
" Bachelier Smith certainly agrees. She revealed, saying,
 "2019 is sure to see most designers blurring the lines on what is men's/women's fashion because it's fun to act like a Gemini!"
